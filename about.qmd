<b>City of Asylum, Pittsburgh, PA</b></br>Volunteer, Bookseller, Administrative Assistant, Data Analyst </br>August 2016 – June 2021</br></p>

I started as a volunteer in 2016 and helped with program logistics. I was later employed as a bookseller in 2017 and helped create social media posts to highlight translated literature and our writers-in-residence. In 2019 after I graduated, I was hired full-time as an administrative assistant and promoted to a data analyst position in 2020. I helped shift our usual in-person events to an online platform, and helped analyze audience metrics to apply to grants and showcase our impact to sponsors when funding was cut. </br></br>
City of Asylum, Pittsburgh is the largest sanctuary for exiled writers and artists in the world. City of Asylum's mission is to protect and house exiled writers while also protecting and celebrating freedom of expression by hosting free, multicultural, cross-disciplinary programs at Alphabet City, Pittsburgh.
