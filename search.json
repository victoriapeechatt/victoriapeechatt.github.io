    "text": "Hi, hello! I’m a third year doctoral student at the University of Nevada, Reno in Angela Smilanich’s lab studying plant-insect-natural enemy interactions. As an ecoimmunologist, chemical ecologist, and evolutionary biologist, I am interested in the role chemicals play in caterpillar immunity as they defend themselves from predators, parasitoids, and viruses. Using this multitrophic perspective, I’m hoping to gain insight into the evolution of virulence and the evolution of specialization. Below is an immersive version of my CV with some bonus content.

I was later employed as a bookseller in 2017 and helped create social media posts to highlight translated literature and our writers-in-residence. In 2019 after I graduated, I was hired full-time as an administrative assistant and promoted to a data analyst position in 2020. I helped shift our usual in-person events to an online platform, and helped analyze audience metrics to apply to grants and showcase our impact to sponsors when funding was cut.  City of Asylum, Pittsburgh is the largest sanctuary for exiled writers and artists in the world. City of Asylum’s mission is to protect and house exiled writers while also protecting and celebrating freedom of expression by hosting free, multicultural, cross-disciplinary programs at Alphabet City, Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\n Dhirana, Pittsburgh, PA  Social Media and Design Committee, Sponsorship Committee, Executive Board August 2015 – May 2019 \n\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, I helped design the logo, merchandise, and social media for our organization to be distributed and marketed. In 2018, I helped raise $50,001 to donate to the Birmingham Free Clinic in Pittsburgh. BFC’s mission is to provide healthcare to the uninsured in Pittsburgh. In 2019, I connected Dhirana with national and international companies and got sponsors to fund our mission.  Dhirana is a student-run non-profit organization whose mission is to 1) bring awareness and appreciation to Indian Classical Dance, 2) provide a platform for collegiate Indian Classical dancers to perform and compete at the national level, 3) give back to the community by donating all ticket sales to Birmingham Free Clinic.\n\n\n\n\nSkills\n\nLanguages: English (native), Malayalam (native), Spanish (basic)\nProgramming Languages: R, Python, Latex, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C++, MATLAB, UNIX\nLab: DNA extractions, quantitative PCR, PCR gel electrophoresis, immune assays (hemocyte counts, phenoloxidase activity, melanization of filaments), chemical analyses (in training)\nPractical: Wilderness Training (6/10/2024), First Aid CPR AED (1/15/2023)\nArts + Hobbies: Bharatanatyam (since 2000), volleyball (since 2009), poetry (since 2011)\n\n\n\nUses\n               \n\n\n\nSide Quests\n\nClimbing\n\nIn September 2024, I won a scholarship to attend a trad climbing festival hosted by Flash Foxy in North Conway, New Hampshire. It was an incredible experience - I learned trad climbing and did my first multipitch with the TradDads. I wrote about my experience here.\n\n \n\n\nVolleyball\n\nGrowing up, volleyball was my favorite sport to play. All through middle school, high school, and college, I found all the spaces where people played (beach, grass, court) and I kept playing. Recently, my team became champions of the Reno City A League (Spring 2023).\n\n \n\n\nRoadtrip across the continental USA\n\nMy sister and I road tripped across the United States in 2021 while I was moving to Reno. It was an awesome drive and we took the opportunity to see as much as we could along the way. I wrote about our trip which you can access below through PolarSteps.\n\n\n\n\n\nMotion Capture for a Short Film\n\nI joined Ripieno Studios at the Carnegie Mellon Entertainment Technology Center to make this short film. I represented Bharatanatyam, an Indian Classical Dance form that originated over 2000 years ago by choreographing a segment and getting motion captured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDance\n\nFour years old until now - that’s how long I’ve been dancing. Classically trained in bharatanatyam - a 2000+ year old Indian dance form, I performed on stages all over the country. In college, I was co-captain of Pitt’s very own Indian Classical Dance team: Nrityamala. We won first place at a competition at George Mason University in 2017, and audience’s choice at Penn State.\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
