In 2019, I connected Dhirana with national and international companies and got sponsors to fund our mission.  Dhirana is a student-run non-profit organization whose mission is to 1) bring awareness and appreciation to Indian Classical Dance, 2) provide a platform for collegiate Indian Classical dancers to perform and compete at the national level, 3) give back to the community by donating all ticket sales to Birmingham Free Clinic.\n\n\n\n\nAwards\n\n\n\nColumn 1\n\n\nColumn 2\n\n\nColumn 3\n\n\n\n\ncontent\n\n\ncontent\n\n\ncontent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkills\n\nLanguages: English (native), Malayalam (native), Spanish (basic)\nProgramming Languages: R, Python, Latex, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C++, MATLAB, UNIX\nLab: DNA extractions, quantitative PCR, PCR gel electrophoresis, immune assays (hemocyte counts, phenoloxidase activity, melanization of filaments), chemical analyses (in training)\nPractical: Wilderness Training (6/10/2024), First Aid CPR AED (1/15/2023)\nArts + Hobbies: Bharatanatyam (since 2000), volleyball (since 2009), poetry (since 2011)\n\n\n\nUses\n               \n\n\n\nSide Quests\n\nTrad Climbing Festival\n\nI joined Ripieno Studios at the Carnegie Mellon Entertainment Technology Center to make this short film.
